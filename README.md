# Background-removal-OpenCV
Don't we all love to play with backgrounds in google meet/zoom/or any other video platform?
I am sure the answr would be yes!

So, here's my version of playing with the backgrounds using OpenCV and python.

Libraries used:

-> cv2 - reading and displaying video

-> cvzone - OpenCV package which makes it easier to run AI based small functions like face detection, hand tracking, etc; In this project SelfiSegmentation is used to remove the original backgrounds with different images.

-> os - for reading all the images stored in the Bg Images folder.

Functions ->
 -> d : changes the bg images in forward direction
 
 -> a : changes the bg images in backward direction
 
 -> q : exit
